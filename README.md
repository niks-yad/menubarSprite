2. **Extract** MenuBarSprite.app 
3. **Drag** MenuBarSprite.app to your Applications folder
4. **Right-click** the app and select **"Open"** (don't double-click!)
5. **Click "Open"** when macOS asks "Are you sure you want to open it?"
6. **Grant accessibility permissions** when prompted

The security warning only appears the first time. After that, the app launches normally.
